SmartPaymentDescriptor is a lightweight format for exchanging a payment
information. A vCard for payment instead of contacts, if you will..

This Java library simplifies adding the support for generating/validating the SmartPaymentDescriptor
(both file and QR code generation) to any Java based system.
